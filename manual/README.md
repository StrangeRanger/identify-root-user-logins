# The Way This Script Is Used
This version of the script is created with the intent of being executed manually. Execution command: `sudo python3 root-login-search.py`

## Other Notes:
- By default, the auth.log will be scanned up to 7 days worth of logs. If you wish to change the number of days, change the value of N in the script.
