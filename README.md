# Identify Root User Logins
[![Project Status: Inactive â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state but is no longer being actively developed; support/maintenance will be provided as time allows.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/inactive.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#inactive)

The script was created for the purpose of identifying users, on a linux based system, who have have successfully and unsuccessfully logged into/switch to the root user account as well as those who have successfully and unsuccessfully switched to a different user on the system. It does this by looking for a hard coded pattern/string/set of lines that are written to `/var/log/auth.log`. These patterns can be looked at in `identifying-patterns.odt`.

## Specifics
- There are two versions of the script. One is designed for manual execution. The other is designed to be executed as a CronJob.
- When executing either versions of the script, you **must** use `sudo` or else an error will be produced telling you that you do not have permission to read the log. 

## Security Features/Notes:
- This script identifies user who have used `sudo bash`, `sudo -i`, `sudo su`, and `su`/`su root`
- If a user on the system created a temporary account in order to log in as root, then deletes the account after he or she is done with it, the temporary account will still show up in the scan results.
- Any and all users who use `sudo su` to change to another user will be marked/identified. This makes it easier to identify a user who tries to blame a different user for logging in as root. (see Script Notes/Faults below)
- Any and all users who attempt to either log into the root account or switch users, and are unsuccessful, will be identified and marked down.
- Users who are not in the sudoers file and try to execute a command with root privilege, will be identified.

## Script Faults/Limitations (IMPORTANT)
- If a user with sudo power, call him Mal, switches to another user who may or may not have sudo power, call him Vic, then uses `sudo` or `su`, will cause Vic to be blamed for executing the commands instead of Mal. Though, Mal must know Vic's password in order successfully use sudo. The best way to verify who actually did it is 
  - Semi-built in helper: Because the script will identify users who use `su` and `sudo su`, Mal will be identified as an individual who switched users.
  - Method of weeding out true culprit: Look through the auth.log at the logs taken on the given day that the incident took place... To know what to look for, please refer to "identifying-patterns.odt"; it contains all auth.log logs that are created in relation to the given commands and there relative success or failure...
- If a user who is attempting to log into the root account or another user via `sudo su <username`, then uses "control + z" to quit the action, before the max password attempts are reached, the script will not be able to identify that user due to the needed logs not being created

## Flaws (that will be fixed, hopefully, in the future) (IMPORTANT)
- If a user inputs their sudo password correctly when executing `sudo su <username>`, but the username does not exist, they will still be marked as `<username> has switched users <n> time(s)`.

# What It Doesn't Do
- The script will not identify the root user itself for anything, even if it does/meets the requirements/identifiers that are mentioned above. This means that if for some reason root changes to another user, the script will not identify root doing this.
